<P>Remember Our Summer - FrogMonster
<P>Lyrics by：Nuowen Tu-Wang/Qingyang Zhang
<P>Composed by：Nuowen Tu-Wang/Qingyang Zhang
<P>Lately I wanna stay awake
<P>I don't want the days to end
<P>I know you'll fly away
<P>Need to hold you for myself
<P>I feel the time run through my hands
<P>Try to grab it but it fades
<P>Say goodbye in all the possible ways
<P>I don't want you to get lost
<P>Will we ever meet again
<P>I'll anesthetize the pain
<P>Please remember our summers
<P>My heart is closed by duel
<P>Will I learn to love again
<P>Who will walk with me in the rain
<P>Please remember our summers
<P>Come the sun
<P>Come the rain
<P>And the leaves falling
<P>I will wait even if the seasons change
<P>Anxiety runs through my veins
<P>I'll escape from all these chains
<P>Say come back in all the possible ways
<P>I don't want you to get lost
<P>Will we ever meet again
<P>I'll anesthetize the pain
<P>Please remember our summers
<P>My heart is closed by duel
<P>Will I learn to love again
<P>Who will walk with me in the rain
<P>Please remember our summers</P>
